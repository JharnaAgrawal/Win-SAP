Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) provides an easy way for businesses to manage identity and access, both in the cloud and on-premises. Your users can use the same work or school account for single sign-on to any cloud and on- premises web application. Users can use their favorite devices, including iOS, Mac OS X, Android, and Windows. An Organization can protect sensitive data and applications both on-premises and in the cloud with integrated multi- factor authentication ensuring secure local and remote access. Azure AD extends your on-premises directories so that information workers can use a single organizational account to securely and consistently access their corporate resources. Azure AD also offers comprehensive reports, analytics, and self-service capabilities to reduce costs and enhance security. The Azure AD SLA ensures that your business always runs smoothly and can be scaled to enterprise levels.

    <p>
    Go to transaction SM59 in your SAP system and create new RFC destination of type ‘G’. Maintain your Azure Active directory endpoint in the Target host and Event Hub name in path prefix for authorization token as shown below.
    </p>
</div>

Target host: **login.microsoftonline.com**

Port: 443

Path Prefix: **/InputTenantID/oauth2/token**

For Tenant ID details and creating a new tenant id in Azure Active Directory, please refer this document section
‘How to setup Azure Active Directory in Azure?’

        <a href="#TOC">5.3 Configuration</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
   ABAP SDK has following main configuration tables and they need to be maintained. We will create a new Interface ID to establish connection between SAP system and target Azure Active Directory (AAD). A new Interface ID needs to be created for each AAD namespace.
    </p>
</div>

**ZREST_CONFIG** – Master Table for Interface ID Maintenance. You must define a new Interface name and maintain the RFC destination that was created for target Event hub.

**ZREST_CONF_MISC** – This is an Interface Miscellaneous table which contains information on Alerts and re-processing of failed messages automatically.

**ZADF_CONFIG** – This is an Interface extension table. This stores data that is more specific to Azure Services like SAS keys, AAD secrets and processing Method.

<div id="heading--1-4">
    <h3>
        <a href="#TOC">ZREST_CONFIG</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
   Create a new Interface ID like ‘DEMO_AAD’ and Maintain the RFC destination you created earlier.
    </p>
</div>

![](MD%20image/52.png)

<div id="heading--1-5">
    <h3>
        <a href="#TOC">ZREST_CONF_MISC</a>

    <p>
   Create an entry in table ‘ZREST_CONF_MISC’ for the above interface Id ‘DEMO_AAD’.
    </p>
</div>

Details of configuration:

•	METHOD is ‘POST’.

•	MAX_RETRY is number of retry in case of service failure.

•	EMAIL_ID is the email id for sending alerts.

•	MAIL_BODY_TXT is Text Id to be maintained for the mail content.

•	RETRY_METHOD is type of retrial (Regular ‘0’ or exponential ‘1’)

   Create an entry in table ‘ZADF_CONFIG’ for the above interface Id ‘DEMO_AAD’.
    </p>
</div>

Details of configuration:

•	INTERFACE_TYPE is ‘Azure Active Directory’.

•	SAS_KEY is the shared access key. This is the key which   generated in AAD under section ‘Generate keys for your application’ Step 7 (refer Page 8). You need to change this key in this config table whenever key is changed in Azure.

•	URI is left blank. This may be required for future versions.

•	SERVICE_TYPE can be synchronous(S) or asynchronous(A)

•	IS_TRY is a reprocessing flag, maintain as blank or ‘X’. it can be configured for reprocessing in case of failure of services.
